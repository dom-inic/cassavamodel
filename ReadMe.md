# Cassava Leaf Disease Classifier

A cassava leaf disease classification model using PyTorch, OpenCV, and Streamlit. This project aims to identify and classify various diseases affecting cassava leaves, leveraging deep learning and computer vision techniques for agricultural support.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Model**: Built with PyTorch for high-accuracy classification.
- **Image Processing**: Utilizes OpenCV for pre-processing images.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Streamlit front end for easy interaction and classification display.

## Requirements

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the Model

``` bash
python main.py

```

Run streamlit app 
``` bash
streamlit run app.py

```
